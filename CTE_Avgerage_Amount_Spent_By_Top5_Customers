This SQL query calculates the average amount paid by the top 5 customers, based on their total payment amount. The query uses CTEs to sequentially filter and aggregate data from the database.

-- CTE to identify the top 10 countries by the number of customers
WITH top_countries AS
(
	SELECT CO1.country
	FROM customer C1
	INNER JOIN address A1 ON C1.address_id = A1.address_id
	INNER JOIN city CI1 ON A1.city_id = CI1.city_id
	INNER JOIN country CO1 ON CI1.country_id = CO1.country_id
	GROUP BY CO1.country
	ORDER BY COUNT (C1.customer_id) DESC
	LIMIT 10
),

-- CTE to identify the top 10 cities within the top 10 countries
top_cities AS
(
	SELECT CI2.city
	FROM customer C2
	INNER JOIN address A2 ON C2.address_id = A2.address_id
	INNER JOIN city CI2 ON A2.city_id = CI2.city_id
	INNER JOIN country CO2 ON CI2.country_id = CO2.country_id
	WHERE CO2.country IN
	(
		SELECT *
		FROM top_countries
	)
	GROUP BY CO2.country, CI2.city
	ORDER BY COUNT(C2.customer_id) DESC
	LIMIT 10
),

-- CTE to select the top 5 paying customers within the top 10 cities
top_customers AS
(
	SELECT SUM(P3.amount) AS total_payment
	FROM customer C3
	INNER JOIN address A3 ON C3.address_id = A3.address_id
	INNER JOIN city CI3 ON A3.city_id = CI3.city_id
	INNER JOIN country CO3 ON CI3.country_id = CO3.country_id
	INNER JOIN payment P3 ON C3.customer_id = P3.customer_id
	WHERE CI3.city IN
	(
		SELECT *
		FROM top_cities
	)
	GROUP BY C3.first_name, C3.last_name, CI3.city, CO3.country
	ORDER BY total_payment DESC
	LIMIT 5
)

-- Final query to calculate the average amount paid by the top 5 customers
SELECT AVG(total_payment)
FROM top_customers
